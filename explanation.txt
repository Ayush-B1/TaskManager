Smart Contract Integration The application uses Ethereum blockchain through a smart contract (TaskContract.sol) which provides:
Task creation and storage on the blockchain
Status updates tracking
Task completion verification
Immutable record of task history
Blockchain Service Layer The blockchainService.js handles:
Connection to Ethereum network (configured at http://localhost:8546)
Smart contract interaction using Web3.js
Task creation and status updates on the blockchain
Task Creation Flow When a task is created:
javascript

Transaction hash is stored with the tas
1. MongoDB stores the task details2. Blockchain creates an immutable record3. Transaction hash is stored with the task
Data Model Integration The Task.js includes blockchain-specific fields:
javascript

blockchainTaskId
blockchainTxHash: String,    // Stores the transaction hashblockchainTaskId: Number     // Stores the task ID on blockchain
API Integration The task routes (taskRoutes.js) handle:
Creating tasks in both MongoDB and blockchain
Updating task status with blockchain verification
Maintaining consistency between blockchain and database
Key Benefits
Immutability: Task history cannot be altered
Verification: Task status changes are verified on blockchain
Transparency: All task updates are traceable
Security: Blockchain ensures data integrity
Technical Implementation The blockchain integration uses:
Web3.js for Ethereum interaction
Smart contract written in Solidity
Local Ethereum network (can be configured for testnet/mainnet)
Transaction signing and verification
This blockchain integration provides an additional layer of security and verification to the task management system, ensuring that task histories are immutable and verifiable.
